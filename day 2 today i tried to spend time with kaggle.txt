day 2 today i tried to spend time with kaggle i tried to make things 
i was looking where i can get interest in kaggle 
competitions is the best way that exict any person 
but i need something where i can learn and also i can contribute 

today i become contributer i given comment and participate the one competition 
sales order - time series forecasting  i started the competition with the help of 
gpt i submitted the csv file generated by gpt 

but i need aim small aim to achieve i also tried to generate synthetic data 
to get bronze for the dataset 

but i understood one game i don't want to become kaggle grandmaster 
mainly i want to take fun of this and eventually become something 
i will not get anything if i plan do competition with intentions try to 
achieve everything for some title so that i get good job . so main thing 
is i should add value proposition it should be fun where you are expert of anything 

second things are there you can align series of short goal if you want to reach the title 
and learn from it 

i things with usecase in ai i can create usecase that will be reading worth while and be useful to anyone 

same way i can create kaggle notebook related to various usecase , dataset with respect to usecase ,
dicussion with respect to usecase , i can't do competition with respect to usecase 

for that we can go with mix approach because competition is the main thing that gives you huge learning 



for compeition - will choose progression path with that parallel we can work on other things also 
for notebook, dataset and dicussion - we can start with usecase in ai

Expert 

Competitions 2 Bronze medals 
Notebooks 5 bronze medals - need to spread usecases in ai notebooks 
Dicussion 50 bronze medals - need to dicuss various usecase in ai
