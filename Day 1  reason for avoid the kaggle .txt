Day 1 : reason for avoid the kaggle and starting the kaggle 

i was little arrogant the life is too good . there are another ways to be expert in data science . but kaggle keeps me in practice 
that what i believe until pratice or time spent i will not become a good data scientist . 
another reason is to be start usecase in ai which is brand . if any person is kaggle expert i think someone will listen to me 

i have huge aim i don't i am able to do it . because i am not consistent on things . but we have to dream big always !!

i don't know how many hours i will be in front of computer 

how many hours i will sacrifice my life for this 

will it be fun 

will i get addicted with kaggle 

can i able to compete as i don't know DSA of that level 

Let's see !!
